# Project Overview
A new information era has been ushered in by the quick expansion of data collection. The usage of data to develop more effective systems is where recommendation systems are useful.  One kind of information filtering system is a recommendation system, which enhances the quality of search results by presenting items that are more pertinent to the search query or are connected to the user's search history. Recommendation systems (RS) belong to the category of information filtering systems designed to predict the preference users would give to a topic. They mimic the social action of relying on recommendations from others and augment the process further (Khanal, 2020). They are employed to forecast a user's preference or rating for a product. Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. Moreover, companies like Netflix and Spotify depend highly on the effectiveness of their recommendation engines for their business and success.

There are several ways to build a recommendation system, content based filtering is used in this notebook. In this notebook, the solution will be used to see recommendation result. Based on several parameters, the model will recommend different types of movies based to the user. Dataset being used in this notebook is from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).

## Business Understanding

### Problem Statements
- Building a solution which can identify and recommend movies based on several parameters
- Evaluating the result

### Goals
- Using machine learning, namely recommendation system to recommend movies to the user
- Model performs well

### Solution Statements
- Using cosine similiearity and TF-IDF for content based filtering
- Comparing the recommendations with a random


# Data Understanding

The first dataset contains the following features:
<br>
- movie_id - A unique identifier for each movie.
- cast - The name of lead and supporting actors.
- crew - The name of Director, Editor, Composer, Writer etc.
<br>
<br>

The second dataset contrains the following features:
- budget - The budget in which the movie was made.
- genre - The genre of the movie, Action, Comedy ,Thriller etc.
- homepage - A link to the homepage of the movie.
- id - This is infact the movie_id as in the first dataset.
- keywords - The keywords or tags related to the movie.
- original_language - The language in which the movie was made.
- original_title - The title of the movie before translation or adaptation.
- overview - A brief description of the movie.
- popularity - A numeric quantity specifying the movie popularity.
- production_companies - The production house of the movie.
- production_countries - The country in which it was produced.
- release_date - The date on which it was released.
- revenue - The worldwide revenue generated by the movie.
- runtime - The running time of the movie in minutes.
- status - "Released" or "Rumored".
- tagline - Movie's tagline.
- title - Title of the movie.
- vote_average - average ratings the movie recieved.
- vote_count - the count of votes recieved.

Based on graphs and the data in the dataset :
- There are several null values in tagline, release date, overview, runtime, and homepage
- there are numerical and non numerical datas
- Most ratings is at 7-8
- The most common language is english
- Most of the moviess ehre has been released

Steps needed to do in data preparation:
-  handle the null values, delete the rows containing those movie_id
-  filter the unused columns

# Data Preparations

## Steps
- add no taglines in null values of tagline
- remove null valls in overview, runtime, and release date
- remove id column

Null values must be removed from the dataset so the model can efficiently learn.

# Modelling - Content Based Filtering

TF-IDF on overview column. his technique converts each movie’s plot summary into a numerical vector that reflects the importance of each word relative to the entire collection of overviews. Words that appear frequently in a specific movie’s overview but rarely across all movies get higher weights, capturing what makes that movie’s description unique.

Once all the overviews are transformed into these TF-IDF vectors, we use cosine similarity to measure how alike two movies are based on their plots. Cosine similarity calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. A similarity score of 1 means the plots are identical in terms of word distribution, while a score close to 0 means they share very little in common. By computing cosine similarity between all pairs of movies, we can find which films have the most similar story descriptions and use that information to recommend movies that are likely related in content.

# Evaluation
For this section, the model will be evaluated. To evaluate how well the recommendation system works, recommended movies are to see the similarity than the original movie, based on their plot descriptions. A random set of movies will be picked, and for each one, its top recommended movies using the system will be found. Then, to have something to compare against, the same number of random movies from the dataset will be picked. For each original movie, the average similarity between its plot and those of both the recommended movies and the random movies will be measured. 

The results show that the movies recommended by the system are much more similar to the original films compared to randomly picked movies. On average, the similarity between a movie and its recommended titles was around 0.114, while the similarity with random movies was close to zero. This means the recommendations aren’t just random—they actually reflect meaningful connections based on the movie plots.
